    "# Data Exploration and PreProcessing Notebook\n",
    "Welcome to the Data Exploration and Preprocessing Notebook for our project, delivered in Part 1 of our data science endeavor. This Jupyter notebook serves as a comprehensive guide detailing the exploration and preprocessing steps applied to the raw data. Our objective is to provide insight into the initial stages of our data analysis pipeline, including data cleansing, feature engineering, and any transformations performed on the dataset.\n",
